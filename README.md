# Project_Slojd_web2py

##How to run:
Make sure you install Web2Py by following some instructions online.
http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download

After installing web2py,
you can clone this project into the applications folder from your web2py folder.
The web2py folder is created I believe if you downloaded the source version.

Once done, just go onto your terminal and cd into the folder location of your web2py and type in: python web2py.py

Once it starts, there would be some popup. Add in some password and connect to the server. 
On a browser, some http://127.0.0.1:8000/welcome/default/index should appear.

Click on interactive interface and type in your password. 

If you installed the project correctly in your application folder, you should be able to see the project name.
Click on it to proceed to the project.
  
## In the project
There shall be Haikus!
In the site there will be a Haiku that would be generated the moment you enter. This is from the Haiku Version 2.0 that shows by default. 
There's 3 buttons on type and if you click on "Purely Random Haiku", it would generate a random Haiku.

In Create, due to time constraints, if you type in three words that are contained in our dictionary, each line of the Haiku would contain your word. If one of the words is not contained, it would not show anything.
