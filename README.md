##How to run:
Make sure you install Web2Py by following some instructions online.
http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download

After installing web2py,
you can clone this project into the applications folder from your web2py folder.
The web2py folder is created I believe if you downloaded the source version.

Once done, just go onto your terminal and run the project with web2py

Once it starts, there would be some popup. Add in some password and connect to the server. 
On a browser, some http://127.0.0.1:8000/welcome/default/index should appear.

Click on interactive interface and type in your password. 

If you installed the project correctly in your application folder, you should be able to see the project name.
Click on it to proceed to the project.

There shall be Haikus!
